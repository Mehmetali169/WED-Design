                <h3>The Republic of Albania – a sovereign state located on the Balkan Peninsula in South-eastern 
                  Europe.[1] It has a coast on the Adriatic Sea to the west, and on the Ionian Sea to the southwest.
                   It is less than 100 km (62 mi) from Italy, across the Strait of Otranto. Albania is a parliamentary 
                   democracy that is transforming its economy into a market-oriented system. The Albanian capital, 
                   Tirana, is home to 350,000 of the country's 3.6 million population. As a result of the opening of 
                   the country in the post-communist era, Albania is now undergoing a development boom as its 
                   telecommunications, transport and utilities infrastructure is being revamped. The country has 
                   been a member of NATO since 2009.</h3>

                <h3>Tirana was founded as a city in 1614 by the Ottoman Albanian general Sylejman Pasha Bargjini
                   and flourished by then around the Old Mosque and the türbe. The area that today corresponds to 
                   the city's territory has been continuously inhabited since the Iron Age. It was inhabited by 
                   Illyrians, and was most likely the core of the Illyrian Kingdom of the Taulantii, which in 
                   Classical Antiquity was centred in the hinterland of Epidamnus. Following the Illyrian Wars 
                   it was annexed by Rome and became an integral part of the Roman Empire. The heritage of that 
                   period is still evident and represented by the Mosaics of Tirana. Later, in the 5th and 6th 
                   centuries, an Early Christian basilica was built around this site.</h3>

                <h3>The area examined by the Italian Financial Police is around Gjirokaster, in the Southern 
                  part of Albania. The Albanian capital of marijuana is located there: the notorious village 
                  of Lazarat.In a mountainous area, 30 kilometers from the Greek border, with a population of 
                  about 3,000, Lazarat enjoys international fame as the capital of marijuana, out of the 
                  control of Albanian authorities.The legend has gained strength after two Dutch youngsters 
                  made a video  of their trip to Albania with an interesting stop over at the village, where 
                  they caught hundreds of marijuana plants on video; they got stoned and recounted, on video, 
                  how the village was filled with marijuana, how someone had given them 4 or 5 grams, how entire
                   families grow plants and how children walk among the cannabis fields on their way to school.</h3>

                  <h3>Sarandë is a resort on the Albanian Riviera, in southern Albania. Sandwiched between the 
                    Ionian Sea and hills of olive groves, the town is on a horseshoe-shaped bay, edged by beaches 
                    and a promenade. In the center are the archaeological remains of a 5th-century synagogue, 
                    later an early Christian basilica. Intricate floor mosaics are still evident. The 16th-century 
                    Lëkurësi Castle is on a hilltop above the town. </h3>
