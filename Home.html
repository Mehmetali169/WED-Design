                 Albanian cuisine is a representative of the cuisine of the Mediterranean.
                 It is also an example of the Mediterranean diet based on the importance 
                 of olive oil, fruits, vegetables and fish.[1] The cooking traditions of 
                 the Albanian people are diverse in consequence of the environmental
                  factors that are more importantly suitable for the cultivation of nearly
                   every kind of herbs, vegetables and fruits.[2] Olive oil is the most 
                   ancient and commonly used vegetable fat in Albanian cooking, produced 
                   since antiquity throughout the country particularly along the coasts.
                   The cuisine of the central region is threefold of rural, mountainous
                    and coastal. The central region is the flattest and rich in vegetation 
                    and biodiversity as well as culinary specialties. It has Mediterranean 
                    characteristics due to its proximity to the sea, which is rich in fish.
                     Dishes here include several meat specialties and desserts of all kinds.

                Albanian culture or the culture of Albanians (Albanian: kultura shqiptare 
                [kultuˈɾa ʃcipˈtaɾɛ]) is a term that embodies the artistic, culinary, 
                literary, musical, political and social elements that are representative of 
                ethnic Albanians, which implies not just Albanians of the country of Albania 
                but also Albanians of Kosovo, North Macedonia and Montenegro, where ethnic 
                Albanians are a native population. Albanian culture has been considerably 
                shaped by the geography and history of Albania, Kosovo, parts of Montenegro,
                 parts of North Macedonia, and parts of Northern Greece, traditional homeland
                  of Albanians. It grew from that of the Paleo-Balkan cultures, including 
                  Proto-Albanian, Illyrian, Thracian, Dacian, with their pagan beliefs and 
                  specific way of life in the wooded areas of far Southern Europe. Albanian 
                  culture has also been influenced by the Ancient Greeks, Romans, Byzantines
                   and Ottomans.

                    Tourism in Albania has been a key element to the country's economic activity 
                 and is constantly developing. Albania is characterized by its rich archaeological 
                 and cultural heritage dating back to the classical period when Illyrians and 
                 Ancient Greeks inhabited the region. Over the course of history, the territory 
                 of Albania was occupied and populated by Romans, Byzantines, Venetians and 
                 Ottomans. Notably the country features unspoiled beaches, mountainous 
                 landscapes, traditional cuisine, archaeological artifacts, unique traditions, 
                 low prices and the wild atmosphere of the countryside.
                 The country lies in Southeastern Europe bordering Montenegro 
                 to the northwest, Kosovo to the northeast, North Macedonia to the
                 east and Greece to the south. The Mediterranean Sea with the Adriatic
                  and Ionian Sea make up the entire west border of the country.

            <h2>Albanian Mafia</h2>

            <p>
                Albanian mafia or Albanian organized crime (Albanian: Mafia Shqiptare) are 
                the general terms used for criminal organizations based in Albania or 
                composed of ethnic Albanians. Albanian organized crime is active in Europe, 
                North America, South America, and various other parts of the world including 
                the Middle East and Asia.[7] The Albanian Mafia participates in a diverse 
                range of criminal enterprises including trafficking in drugs, arms, and humans. 
                Thanks to their close ties with the 'Ndrangheta of Calabria, they control a 
                large part of the billion dollar wholesale cocaine market in Europe and appear 
                to be the primary distributors of cocaine in various European drug hubs including
                 London.[5][8][4] Albanian organized crime is characterized by diversified criminal 
                 enterprises which, in their complexity, demonstrate a very high criminal capacity. 
                 In Albania, there are over 15 mafia families that control organized crime. According
                  to some sources, Albania is the first European narco state.[9]
