                <h2>Population</h2>
                <p>The Albania Population (Live) counter shows a continuously updated estimate 
                    of the current population of Albania delivered by Worldometer's RTS algorithm,
                     which processes data collected from the United Nations Population Division.
                     The Population of Albania (1950 - 2023) chart plots the total population 
                     count as of July 1 of each year, from 1950 to 2023.The Yearly Population
                      Growth Rate chart plots the annual percentage changes in population
                       registered on July 1 of each year, from 1951 to 2023. This value can 
                       differ from the Yearly % Change shown in the historical table, which 
                       shows the last year equivalent percentage change assuming homogeneous 
                       change in the preceding five year period.Demographic features of the 
                       population of Albania include population density, ethnicity, education 
                       level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations 
                       and other aspects. The demography of the Albania is monitored by the 
                       Institute of Statistics of Albania. The institute has performed
                        demographic censuses since the 1920s.[3] The latest census in 
                        Albania was performed in April 2011, and has been deemed as unreliable 
                        both within and outside Albania.Albania is a fairly linguistically 
                        homogeneous country with ethnic Albanians forming the majority in
                         the country. Albania had 2,761,785 inhabitants on 1 January 2023, 
                         according to the most recent INSTAT estimate.[4]Albania has a high 
                         Human Development Index of 0.764, ranking 75th in the world in 2016.
                         [9] In 2016, Albania had a total population of 2,786,026, 1,361,326 
                         being males and 1,424,700 females. 42,922 inhabitants have left Albania
                          and in the same year the number of immigrants in the country was
                           25,846.[10]With an estimated population of 2.76 million in 2023,
                            Albania ranks 136th in the world by population. The population 
                            density is 101 inhabitants per square kilometre.</p>

                <h2>religious history</h2>
                  <p>Albania has been a secular state since 1912, and as such, is "neutral in 
                     questions of belief and conscience":[3] The former socialist government 
                     declared Albania the world's first "atheist state", even though the Soviet 
                     Union had already done so.[4][5][6][7] Believers faced harsh punishments, 
                     and many clergymen were killed. Religious observance and practice is generally
                     lax today, and polls have shown that, compared to the populations of other 
                     countries, few Albanians consider religion to be a dominant factor in their 
                     lives. When asked about religion, people generally refer to their family's
                     historical religious legacy and not to their own choice of faith.Christianity 
                     spread to urban centers in the region of Albania, at the time composed mostly 
                     Epirus Nova and part of south Illyricum, during the later period of Roman era
                     and reached the region relatively early. St. Paul preached the Gospel 'even 
                     unto Illyricum' (Romans 15:19). Schnabel asserts that Paul probably preached
                     in Shkodra and Durrës.[8] The steady growth of the Christian community in
                     Dyrrhachium (the Roman name for Epidamnus) led to the creation of a local
                     bishopric in 58 AD. Later, episcopal seats were established in Apollonia,
                     Buthrotum (modern Butrint), and Scodra (modern Shkodra).One notable Martyr
                     was Saint Astius, who was Bishop of Dyrrachium, who was crucified during 
                     the persecution of Christians by the Roman Emperor Trajan. Saint Eleutherius 
                     (not to be confused with the later Saint-Pope) was bishop of Messina and 
                     Illyria. He was martyred along with his mother Anthia during the 
                     anti-Christian campaign of Hadrian.[9]Christian bishops from what would
                      later become eastern Albania took part in the First Council of Nicaea. 
                      Arianism had at that point extended to Illyria, where Arius himself had 
                      been exiled to by Constantine.[11]</p>

                <h2>The capital of marijuana</h2>
                <p>The area examined by the Italian Financial Police is around Gjirokaster, in the
                     Southern part of Albania. The Albanian capital of marijuana is located there: 
                     the notorious village of Lazarat.In a mountainous area, 30 kilometers from the 
                     Greek border, with a population of about 3,000, Lazarat enjoys international 
                     fame as the capital of marijuana, out of the control of Albanian authorities.
                     The legend has gained strength after two Dutch youngsters made a video  of their
                      trip to Albania with an interesting stop over at the village, where they caught 
                      hundreds of marijuana plants on video; they got stoned and recounted, on video,
                      how the village was filled with marijuana, how someone had given them 4 or 5 
                      grams, how entire families grow plants and how children walk among the cannabis 
                      fields on their way to school.According to the latest Italian Financial Police 
                      overflights, apparently in Lazarat there are 319 hectares used for cannabis.
                     This discovery, however, is unlikely to bring about a change, as we are told by 
                     Gijergi Erebara, an Albanian reporter for the daily “Shqip” and Balkan Fellow for 
                     the Balkan Investigative Reporting Network.“There is no will to enter Lazarat and 
                     destroy the plants, because the police is afraid that a war might break out. Growing
                     marijuana in such proportions negatively affects the ability of the government to 
                     control the territory and duly establish the rule of law”.A low intensity war,
                      however, already seems to be in place. In 2007 the police killed an alleged
                       trafficker from Lazarat and, soon after that, the Gjirokaster police station
                        was set on fire. Special forces had to be deployed to quell the unrest. Since 
                        the police cannot enter the village, it periodically cuts supplies: it cuts 
                        running water – cannabis needs a lot of irrigation – and stops commuters who 
                            go to work in the area every day.</p>
